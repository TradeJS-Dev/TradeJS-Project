# Directional parameter split

Use this checkpoint when one isolated shared parameter change helps one
direction and harms the other. It converts a measured side conflict into a
causal core experiment; it is not permission to duplicate every config field.

## Trigger

Run the classifier after a complete reconciled matched comparison:

```bash
node .codex/skills/strategy-release/scripts/directional-parameter-checkpoint.mjs \
  --input <directional-parameter-input.json> \
  > <directional-parameter-decision.json>
```

Classify each side with the preregistered side rule as `improved`, `worsened`,
`neutral`, or `inconclusive`. Require adequate independent support, the intended
trace transition, and a one-parameter config delta. A split is required only
for `LONG improved / SHORT worsened` or the mirrored conflict.

Do not trigger from aggregate PnL alone, one profitable symbol/event, an
outcome-derived cohort, or an unexplained occupancy change. When the original
candidate changed several fields, run an ablation first.

## Implementation contract

Replace the shared field with two required directional fields:

```text
PARAM_LONG
PARAM_SHORT
```

Both fields must be present in defaults, parser contracts, runtime config, and
state/config identity. Symmetric behavior is represented by equal explicit
values. Missing directional values are invalid configuration; do not infer them
from a removed shared field. Values such as `0`, `false`, and an empty string
remain valid when the field type permits them.

Choose the implementation according to where the value acts:

- `decision_time`: select the required field only after direction is known.
- `detector_state`: a shared detector cannot simply switch values after a
  signal appears. Use isolated replay-safe LONG and SHORT detector state or
  reject the split as architecturally unsafe.
- `shared_lifecycle`: add the explicit pair, but preregister occupancy/cooldown and
  opposite-side identity guardrails because one side can change the other's
  opportunity set.

Include the effective LONG and SHORT values in detector/execution config
identity wherever they can alter replay state or decisions. Add focused tests
for required-field validation, explicit LONG/SHORT resolution, equal-value
symmetry, zero/false values, config isolation, replay reconstruction, and
same-timestamp behavior.

## Minimal research ablation

The global candidate is already evidence. Spend existing child/rescue slots,
not extra trials, on the smallest discriminating set:

1. exact control expressed as equal LONG/SHORT values;
2. target-side-only change, keeping the opposite side at its control value;
3. combined best-per-side pair only when both side values have independent
   prior evidence.

Use an explicit equal-overrides parity case in unit tests; backtest it only when
runner/config resolution parity is uncertain. Do not automatically test a full
Cartesian grid.

For the target side require the frozen improvement rule. For the non-target
side require exact signal/trade identity when architecture guarantees
independence. Otherwise report matched/added/removed identities, occupancy
spillover, N/cadence, PnL/trade, PF, WR, and side-only DD under a preregistered
non-regression rule. Keep aggregate portfolio DD as a separate guardrail.

## Interpretation

- A successful target-only change supports a genuine directional parameter
  asymmetry and may be carried forward as core behavior.
- If the target side improves but the opposite side changes through occupancy,
  judge the whole causal composition rather than claiming isolation.
- If equal explicit values do not reproduce the shared candidate, fix config
  resolution/state identity before using any economics.
- If a detector-state split needs duplicated engines whose state cannot be
  replayed exactly, retire the split rather than accepting runtime divergence.
- Remove the superseded shared field in the same breaking config change. Keep
  symmetric behavior available only through equal explicit directional values.

Persist the classifier input/output, parameter semantics, explicit directional
config contract, resolved configs, implementation tests, side identities, and
decision in the immutable family handoff.
